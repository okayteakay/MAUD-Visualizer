to the VEREIT stockholders at the VEREIT Stockholders Meeting (as defined below) and to the Realty Income stockholders at the Realty Income

the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (of which the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall be a part) with respect to the Realty

hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus cleared by the SEC and the Form S-4 declared effective

VEREIT and Realty Income shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other party with copies of any written comments
and advise the other party of any oral comments with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received from the
SEC. Each party shall cooperate and provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement
to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 prior to filing such with the SEC, and each party will provide the other party
with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to take any action required to be
taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the Mergers and the Realty Income Stock Issuance, and each party shall
furnish all information concerning it and the holders of its capital stock or shares of common stock as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action. Each party will advise the other party, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the

their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by either party, and such information should be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and,
to the extent required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly
filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of VEREIT and Realty Income.</p>

of VEREIT the VEREIT Required Stockholders Vote. VEREIT covenants that, unless a Change in VEREIT Recommendation has occurred in accordance

covenants that the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 will include such recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of this <u>Section 5.1(b)</u>, if, on a date for which the VEREIT Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, VEREIT has not received proxies representing
a sufficient number of shares of VEREIT Common Stock to obtain the VEREIT Required Stockholders Vote, whether or not a quorum is present,

</font>Realty Income shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly
as practicable following the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes effective (the “<u>Realty Income Stockholders Meeting</u>”)
for the purpose of obtaining the Realty Income Required Stockholders Vote. Unless a Change in Realty Income Recommendation has occurred
in accordance with <u>Section 5.4</u>, the Board of Directors of Realty Income shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the
stockholders of Realty Income the Realty Income Required Stockholders Vote. Realty Income covenants that, unless a Change in Realty Income
Recommendation has occurred in accordance with <u>Section 5.4, </u>Realty Income will, through its Board of Directors, recommend to its
stockholders approval of the Realty Income Stock Issuance and further covenants that the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form
S-4 will include such recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this <u>Section 5.1(c)</u>, if, on a date for which
the Realty Income Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, Realty Income has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares
of Realty Income Common Stock to obtain the Realty Income Required Stockholders Vote, whether or not a quorum is present, Realty Income
shall have the right to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Realty Income Stockholders Meeting; <u>provided</u>
that the Realty Income Stockholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than thirty (30) days after the date
for which the Realty Income Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable
Law). Realty Income agrees that, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with <u>Section 7.1</u>, its obligations
to hold the Realty Income Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this <u>Section 5.1(c)</u> shall not be affected by the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to Realty Income of any Acquisition Proposal or by any Change in Realty Income Recommendation.</p>

any COVID-19 Measures, that such access would reasonably be expected to jeopardize the health and safety of any employee of such party
or its Subsidiaries, and (y) Realty Income and its Subsidiaries shall only be required to provide access or make available such information

unreasonably withheld conditioned or delayed), communicate with any employees of the other party, other than, with respect to Realty Income,
the employees set forth on <u>Section 5.2</u> of the Realty Income Disclosure Letter, and with respect to VEREIT, the employees set forth
on <u>Section 5.2</u> of the VEREIT Disclosure Letter<i>;</i> <u>provided</u> that the parties shall, following the date hereof, promptly
develop a mutually acceptable protocol to manage communications between the parties and their employees. In addition, neither party nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information or contravene any Law, rule, regulation,
order, judgment or decree. The parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions
of the preceding sentence apply. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Realty Income nor VEREIT
shall be required to provide any access or make any disclosure to the other pursuant to this&nbsp;<u>Section 5.2</u>&nbsp;to the extent
such access or information is reasonably pertinent to a litigation where Realty Income or any of its affiliates, on the one hand, and
VEREIT or any of its affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties or reasonably likely to become adverse parties.</p>

</font>During the period from the date of this Agreement and the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the date, if any, on which
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to <u>Section 7.1</u> (the “<u>Interim Period</u>”), Realty Income or one or more of
its Subsidiaries may (i) commence any of the following: (A) one or more offers to purchase (including any “change of control offer”
under the VEREIT Notes Indenture and/or the notes issued thereunder) any or all of the outstanding debt issued under the VEREIT Notes
Indenture for cash (collectively, the “<u>Offers to Purchase</u>”); or (B) one or more offers to exchange any or all of the
outstanding debt issued under the VEREIT Notes Indenture for securities issued by the Realty Income or any of its affiliates (the “<u>Offers
to Exchange</u>”); and (ii) solicit the consent of the holders of debt issued under the VEREIT Notes Indenture regarding certain
proposed amendments thereto (the “<u>Consent Solicitations</u>” and, together with the Offers to Purchase and Offers to Exchange,
if any, the “<u>Note Offers and Consent Solicitations</u>”); provided that any such notice or offer shall expressly reflect
that, and it shall be the case that, the closing of any such transaction shall not be consummated until the Effective Time. Any Note Offers
and Consent Solicitations shall be made on such terms and conditions (including price to be paid and conditionality) as are proposed by
Realty Income and which are permitted by the terms of the VEREIT Notes Indenture and applicable Laws, including SEC rules and regulations.
Realty Income shall consult with VEREIT regarding the material terms and conditions of any Note Offers and Consent Solicitations, including
the timing and commencement of any Note Offers and Consent Solicitations and any tender deadlines. Realty Income shall have provided VEREIT
with the necessary offer to purchase, offer to exchange, consent solicitation statement, letter of transmittal, press release, if any,
in connection therewith, and each other document relevant to the transaction that will be distributed by Realty Income in the applicable
Note Offers and Consent Solicitations (collectively, the “<u>Debt Offer Documents</u>”) a reasonable period of time in advance
of commencing the applicable Note Offers and Consent Solicitations to allow VEREIT and its counsel to review and comment on such Debt
Offer Documents, and Realty Income shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made or input provided by VEREIT
and its legal counsel. Subject to the receipt of the requisite holder consents, in connection with any or all of the Consent Solicitations
(including for the avoidance of doubt any other liability management transaction hereunder that includes a Consent Solicitation), VEREIT
shall execute a supplemental indenture to the VEREIT Notes Indenture in accordance with the terms thereof amending the terms and provisions
thereof as described in the applicable Debt Offer Documents in a form as reasonably requested by Realty Income (the “<u>Supplemental
Indenture</u>”); <u>provided</u> that the amendments effected by such supplemental indenture shall not become operative until the
Effective Time. During the Interim Period, at Realty Income’s sole expense, VEREIT shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and
shall cause its and their Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Realty Income to assist Realty Income in
connection with any Note Offers and Consent Solicitations (including using reasonable best efforts to direct VEREIT’s independent
accountants to provide customary consents for use of their reports to the extent required in connection with any Note Offers and Consent
Solicitations). The dealer manager, solicitation agent, information agent, depositary or other agent retained in connection with any Note
Offers and Consent Solicitations will be selected and retained by Realty Income. If, at any time prior to the completion of the Note Offers
and Consent Solicitations, VEREIT or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Realty Income or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other
hand, discovers any information that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Debt Offer Documents, so that the Debt Offer
Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, such party that
discovers such information shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
prepared by Realty Income describing such information shall be disseminated to the holders of the notes outstanding under the VEREIT Notes
Indenture.</p>

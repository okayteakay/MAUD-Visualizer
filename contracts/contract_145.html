take reasonable steps to ensure that a diverse group of qualified candidates are in the pool from which the Board member nominees are chosen. The Governance Committee may at its discretion seek third-party resources to assist in the process and will

resignation for consideration by the Governance Committee within 90 days from the date of the election. The Governance Committee shall consider all of the relevant facts and circumstances and recommend to the Board the action to be taken with
respect to such offer of resignation. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Term Limits </i></b>— The Board does not believe it should establish term limits. While term limits
could help ensure that there are fresh ideas and viewpoints available to the Board, they have the disadvantage of causing the Company to lose the contribution of Directors who have been able to develop, over a period of time, increasing insight into
the Company and its operations and thereby provide an increasing contribution to the Board as a whole. The Board believes an annual assessment of Board and committee performance provides each Director an appropriate opportunity to reflect on the
effectiveness of the Board, and to confirm a Director’s decision to continue as a member of the Board. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Mandatory Retirement </i></b>— <font style="white-space:nowrap">Non-management</font> Directors will retire as of the annual meeting following their 73rd birthday. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Multiple
Directorships </i></b>— The Company recognizes that its Board members benefit from service on the boards of other companies. While that service is encouraged, it is critical that Directors have the opportunity to dedicate sufficient time to

Judgment </i></b>— Directors should exercise their business judgment to act in what they reasonably believe to be in the best interests of the Company in a manner consistent with their fiduciary duties. Directors should regularly attend

scheduled in conjunction with a regularly scheduled Board meeting. The Board expects all Board members to attend regularly scheduled Board and committee meetings and the annual meeting of stockholders, unless there are extenuating circumstances.

comparable companies. Only <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-management</font> Directors shall receive compensation for their services as Director. To create a direct linkage with corporate performance, the Board believes that a meaningful

both positions or if the chair is otherwise not an independent Director, then the <font style="white-space:nowrap">non-management</font> Directors, after consulting with all members of the Board, shall, from time to time, appoint an independent

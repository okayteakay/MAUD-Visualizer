calculation agent for the Series H Preferred Stock during the Floating Rate Period. A “<b>London banking day</b>” shall mean any day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market. </p>

If no offered rate appears on Reuters screen page “LIBOR01” (or any successor or replacement page) on the relevant Dividend Determination Date at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, then the Calculation Agent, in consultation with the
Corporation, will select four major banks in the London interbank market and will request each of their principal London offices to provide a quotation of the rate at which three-month deposits in U.S. dollars in amounts of at least $1,000,000 are
offered by it to prime banks in the London interbank market, on that date and at that time, that is representative of single transactions at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, three-month LIBOR will be the arithmetic average
(rounded upward if necessary to the nearest .00001 of 1%) of the quotations provided. Otherwise, the Calculation Agent, in consultation with the Corporation, will select three major banks in New York City and will request each of them to provide a
quotation of the rate offered by it at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Dividend Determination Date for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks having an index maturity of three months for the applicable dividend period
in an amount of at least $1,000,000, that is representative of single transactions at that time. If three quotations are provided, three-month LIBOR will be the arithmetic average (rounded upward if necessary to the nearest .00001 of 1%) of the
quotations provided. Otherwise, three-month LIBOR for the next Dividend Period will be equal to three-month LIBOR in effect for the then-current Dividend Period or, in the case of the first dividend Period in the Floating Rate Period, the most
recent rate on which three-month LIBOR could have been determined in accordance with the first sentence of this paragraph had the dividend rate been a floating rate during the Fixed Rate Period. </p>

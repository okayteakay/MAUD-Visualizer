are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” The words “hereof,”
 “herein” and “hereunder” and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires. The word “or” shall
not be deemed to be exclusive. The word “extent” and the phrase “to the extent” when used in this Agreement shall
mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such word or phrase shall not mean simply “if.” Except as
otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to “Sections,” “Annexes” and “Exhibits,” are
intended to refer to Sections of this Agreement and the Annexes and Exhibits to this Agreement. All references in this Agreement to “$”

or other document made or delivered pursuant thereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders
of such terms. References in this Agreement to specific Laws or to specific provisions of Laws shall include all rules&nbsp;and regulations
promulgated thereunder. Each of the parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question
of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by all the parties, and no presumption or burden
of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Whenever this
Agreement refers to a number of days, such number shall refer to calendar days unless Business Days are specified. Where used with respect
to information, “made available” or terms of similar import mean made available to Parent and its Representatives in the

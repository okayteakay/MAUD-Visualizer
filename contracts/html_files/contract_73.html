None of the Inphi Entities is a party to any Contract or subject to any Legal Requirement that restricts any Inphi Entity from relocating, consolidating, merging or closing, in whole or in part, any portion of the business of such Inphi Entity.

Except as required by this Agreement, or to the extent permitted pursuant to <u>Section </u><u>4.2(b)</u>, none of the Inphi Entities intends, and none of the Inphi Entities has committed, to establish or enter into any new arrangement that would constitute an Inphi Employee Plan or Inphi Employee Agreement, or to materially modify any Inphi Employee Plan or Inphi Employee Agreement (except to conform any such Inphi Employee Plan or Inphi Employee Agreement to the requirements of any applicable Legal Requirements, in each case as previously disclosed to Marvell in writing). The Company has Made Available to Marvell, in each case, to the extent applicable: (i) accurate and complete copies of all documents setting forth the terms of each material Inphi Employee Plan and each material Inphi Employee Agreement, including all amendments thereto; (ii) the most recent summary plan description, together with summaries of the material modifications thereto, if any, required under ERISA with respect to each material Inphi Employee Plan; (iii) the most recently filed annual report (Form 5500 Series and all schedules and financial statements attached thereto), if any, required under ERISA or the Code in connection with each Inphi Employee Plan; (iv) the trust agreement, insurance Contract or other funding instrument, if any, with respect to each material Inphi Employee Plan; (v) all discrimination tests required under the Code for each Inphi Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code for the three most recent plan years; and (vi) the most recent IRS determination or opinion letter issued with respect to each Inphi Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.</p>

Any Inphi Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and each trust intended to be qualified under Section 501(a) of the Code has obtained a favorable determination letter (or opinion letter, if applicable) as to its qualified status under the Code and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred since the date of the most recent determination that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect such qualification. Each Foreign Inphi Plan intended to qualify for special tax treatment satisfies all requirements for such treatment. No “prohibited transaction,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under Section 408 of ERISA, has occurred with respect to any Inphi Employee Plan between the Company and such Inphi Employee Plan or, to the Knowledge of the Company, between any other Person and such Inphi Employee Plan. Each Inphi Employee Plan that does not constitute a contract can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Closing in accordance with its terms, without material Liability to HoldCo, the Marvell Entities, the Inphi Entities or any ERISA Affiliates (other than ordinary administration expenses). There is no audit, inquiry or Legal Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or reasonably anticipated by the IRS, DOL or any other Governmental Body with respect to any Inphi Employee Plan. None of the Inphi Entities or any ERISA Affiliate has ever incurred any material penalty or Tax with respect to any Inphi Employee Plan under Section 502(i) of ERISA or Sections 4975 through 4980 of the Code. Each of the Inphi Entities and ERISA Affiliates have timely made all contributions and other payments required by and due under the terms of each Inphi Employee Plan, except as would not result in material Liability and, to the extent not yet due, such contributions and other payments have been adequately accrued in the consolidated financial statements (including any related notes) contained or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Reports. Each Foreign Inphi Plan that is required to be registered or approved by any Governmental Body under applicable Legal Requirements has been so registered or approved.</p>

No Inphi Employee Plan subject to ERISA holds stock issued by the Company or any of its current ERISA Affiliates as a plan asset. The fair market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Inphi Plan, the Liability of each insurer for any Foreign Inphi Plan funded through insurance, or the book reserve established for any Foreign Inphi Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide in full for the accrued benefit obligations, with respect to all current and former participants in such Foreign Inphi Plan according to the reasonable actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to and obligations under such Foreign Inphi Plan, and none of the Contemplated Transactions will cause any such assets or insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations.</p>

control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e)&nbsp;and (f), respectively, of Rule&nbsp;13a-15

are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the rules&nbsp;and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant
to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective
in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that (a)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, (b)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company and (c)&nbsp;provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s or any
of the Company Subsidiaries’ assets that would be reasonably likely to have a material effect on its financial statements.

prior to the date of this Agreement, to its auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board of Directors (x)&nbsp;any significant
deficiencies in the design or operation of its internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the Company’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and has identified for the Company’s
auditors and audit committee of its board of directors any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and

notice from the SEC or any other Governmental Entity indicating that any of its accounting policies or practices are or may be
the subject of any review, inquiry, investigation or challenge by the SEC or any other Governmental Entity.</p>

over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e)&nbsp;and (f), respectively, of Rule&nbsp;13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule&nbsp;13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Parent’s disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably
designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules&nbsp;and
forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to Parent’s management as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parent’s internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that (a)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, (b)&nbsp;provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and
that receipts and expenditures of Parent and its Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of Parent and (c)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of Parent’s or any of its Subsidiaries’ assets that would be reasonably likely to have a material
effect on its financial statements. Parent has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of its chief executive officer and
its chief financial officer prior to the date of this Agreement, to its auditors and the audit committee of its board of directors
(x)&nbsp;any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of its internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect Parent’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and has identified
for Parent’s auditors and audit committee of the Parent Board of Directors any material weaknesses in internal control over
financial reporting and (y)&nbsp;any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Parent’s internal control over financial reporting. From March&nbsp;31, 2018 to the date of this Agreement, Parent
has not received written notice from the SEC or any other Governmental Entity indicating that any of its accounting policies or
practices are or may be the subject of any review, inquiry, investigation or challenge by the SEC or any other Governmental Entity.</p>

and Officers’ Insurance and Indemnification</u></font>. For not less than six (6)&nbsp;years from and after the First Effective

officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the “<u>Indemnified Parties</u>”) against any

Effective Time, now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in their respective certificate of incorporation
or by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) or in any agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect. For six years after the Closing, the First Surviving Corporation shall also cause to be maintained in effect the provisions
in (i)&nbsp;the Company Governing Documents and the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary and (ii)&nbsp;any other
agreements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with any Indemnified Party, in each case, regarding elimination or limitation
of liability, indemnification of officers, directors, employees, agents or other fiduciaries and advancement of expenses that
are in existence on the date of this Agreement, and no such provision shall be amended, modified or repealed in any manner that

or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the First Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with
the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Mergers or any of the other Transactions). Parent shall also cause
the Surviving Company to provide, for an aggregate period of not less than six (6)&nbsp;years from the First Effective Time, the
Company’s past and current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for any
acts, omissions, or events occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the First Effective Time (the “<u>D&amp;O
Insurance</u>”) that is no less favorable than the Company’s existing policy or, if insurance coverage that is no
less favorable is unavailable, the best available coverage; <i>provided</i>, <i>however</i>, that (i)&nbsp;the Surviving Company
shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the D&amp;O Insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last
annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (the “<u>Cap Amount</u>”) and (ii)&nbsp;the Company may prior
to the First Effective Time substitute therefor a single premium tail coverage with respect to D&amp;O Insurance with an annual
cost not in excess of the Cap Amount; <i>provided, further, however</i>, that, in each case, if the cost of such insurance exceeds
the Cap Amount, then Parent shall or the Company may, as applicable, purchase as much coverage as is reasonably available for
the Cap Amount. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Indemnified Party notifies Parent on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the First Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such Person may seek indemnification pursuant to this
<u>Section&nbsp;6.4</u>, the provisions of this <u>Section&nbsp;6.4</u> shall continue in effect with respect to such matter until
the final disposition of all claims, actions, investigations, suits and proceedings relating thereto. In the event Parent or the
First Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)&nbsp;consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)&nbsp;transfers
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the First Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this <u>Section&nbsp;6.4</u>. The rights and obligations under this <u>Section&nbsp;6.4</u> shall survive consummation
of the Mergers and shall not be terminated or amended in a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified Party without the written
consent of such Indemnified Party.</p>

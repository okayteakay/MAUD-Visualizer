of such Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such Proceeding or such Indemnified Person otherwise consents thereto
and (iv)&nbsp;the Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Person in the defense of any such matter.

the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws, and any indemnification agreements with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries in
effect as of the Effective Time (collectively, the “<b><i>D&amp;O Indemnification Agreements</i></b>”) and shall not

Such determination shall be based on the weighted average of elections made by the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock who participate in such determination, shall be subject to any limitations to which all of the holders of Common Stock are subject, such as pro rata reductions applicable to any portion of the consideration payable in such Business Combination, and shall be conducted in such a manner as to be completed by the date which is the earliest of (i) the deadline for elections to be made by holders of Common Stock, and (ii) two Trading Days prior to the anticipated effective date of the Business Combination. The Corporation shall provide notice of the opportunity to determine the form of such consideration, as well as notice of the determination made by the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock (and the weighted average of elections), by issuing a press release or providing other appropriate notice, and by providing a copy of such notice to the Board of Directors. If the effective date of the Business Combination is delayed beyond the initially anticipated effective date, the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock shall be given the opportunity to make subsequent similar determinations in regard to such delayed effective date. The documents governing the rights of such securities shall provide for adjustments of the Conversion Rate and other appropriate numerical thresholds which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments of the Conversion Rate provided for in Section 7.
